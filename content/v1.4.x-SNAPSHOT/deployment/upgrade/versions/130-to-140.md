## Deprecation Notice

## Breaking Changes for 1.4.x Stable Release

### Dashboard & Pipeline Source Config Changes

We have restructured how we input the dbServiceNames field, used for creating lineage between pipeline(spline) and tables & dashboard data models and tables. This change was done in order to highlight the field on UI and improve user experience.

Please make note of changes in your yaml.

Before:
```
sourceConfig:
    config:
        type: DashboardMetadata # or PipelineMetadata
        .....
        dbServiceNames:
        - redshift_prod
        .....
```

After 1.4.0 Upgrade:
```
sourceConfig:
    config:
        type: DashboardMetadata # or PipelineMetadata
        .....
        lineageInformation:
            dbServiceNames:
            - redshift_prod
        .....
```
